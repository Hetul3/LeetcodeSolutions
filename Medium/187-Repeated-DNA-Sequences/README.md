## Problem Description
The **DNA sequence** is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.

  * For example, `"ACGAATTCCG"` is a **DNA sequence**.



When studying **DNA** , it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string `s` that represents a **DNA sequence** , return all the **`10`-letter-long** sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
    Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
    Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s[i]` is either `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, or `'T'`.
