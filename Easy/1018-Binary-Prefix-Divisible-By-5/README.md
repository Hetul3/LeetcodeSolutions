# [1018. Binary Prefix Divisible By 5](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-prefix-divisible-by-5/)

![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen)
`Array` `Bit Manipulation`

## Problem Description
You are given a binary array `nums` (**0-indexed**).

We define `xi` as the number whose binary representation is the subarray `nums[0..i]` (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit).

  * For example, if `nums = [1,0,1]`, then `x0 = 1`, `x1 = 2`, and `x2 = 5`.



Return _an array of booleans_`answer` _where_`answer[i]`_is_`true` _if_`xi` _is divisible by_`5`.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    Input: nums = [0,1,1]
    Output: [true,false,false]
    Explanation: The input numbers in binary are 0, 01, 011; which are 0, 1, and 3 in base-10.
    Only the first number is divisible by 5, so answer[0] is true.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    Input: nums = [1,1,1]
    Output: [false,false,false]
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
